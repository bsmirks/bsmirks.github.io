I'm a Software Engineer who loves creating tools and automation. My favorite kind of result is when my product improves people's workflow, automates something new, or accomplishes something in an efficient manner.

- I spend a lot of my time in a terminal or VSCode
- I am currently a Software Engineer III on the Configuration Management team at Walmart, Inc.
- I love configuration management
- I love documentation
- My long term goal is to create a free open source configuration management tool

### What I'm working on

This list includes stuff I'm doing at work too, just keep in mind that I can't be super specific about it.

#### Personal

- [Dotfiles](https://github.com/bsmirks/dotfiles) - After getting my development machine's dotfiles into version control, I need to document what software is included, how to use it, etc.
  - Switched my [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) `init.vim` to [`init.lua`](https://github.com/bsmirks/dotfiles/blob/main/symlinks/nvim/.config/nvim/init.lua).
- [Manypacks](https://github.com/bsmirks/manypacks) - A container image that includes several tools required to be able to create packages for various operating systems.
- LaTeX - I'm currently in the process of writing and formatting my resume in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/). Temporarily a private repository.
- Profesional development - Creating [this website](https://github.com/bsmirks/bsmirks.github.io) and expanding it with GitHub Pages.

#### Professional

- Golang - Writing a command line tool that abstracts the complexity of several internal self-service automation and is designed to save server administrators time.
- Python/API - Created an API that hosts endpoints for some internal self service automation across a couple of different products and use cases.
- Workflow - Working on evaluating and expanding tools I use in my development workflow. For example, I'm switching from using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to [Podman](https://podman.io/).
